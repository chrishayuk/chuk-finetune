In this case, we are subtracting 97 from 62.\n\nTo solve this, we can use a number line or simply perform the subtraction operation directly:\n\n1. Start at the number 62 on the number line.\n2. Move 97 units to the left on the number line.\n3. You will end up at the number -35.\n\nHence, the answer to 62 - 97 is -35.<|endoftext|>", ".\nThe problem involves subtracting 97 from 62. Let's do this step-by-step.\n\nFirst, write the numbers in a column format, aligning the digits by their place values:\n\n```\n  62\n- 97\n```\n\nSince 97 is larger than 62, we cannot subtract 97 from 62 directly. Therefore, we need to borrow from the next higher place value.\n\n1. Borrow 1 from the tens place of 62 (which becomes 5 and 12 in the units place).\n2. Now, 12 minus 7 equals 5.\n3. Next, we borrow 1 from the tens place of the 62 (which becomes 5 and 16 in the tens place).\n4. Now, 16 minus 9 equals 7.\n\nSo, the subtraction becomes:\n\n```\n  55\n-  97\n  5\n```\n\nThus, the answer to the problem \\(62 - 97\\) is \\(\\boxed{-35}\\).<|endoftext|>", ".\nThe answer is -35.<|endoftext|>", ".\n62 - 97 = -35<|endoftext|>"], "teacher_logprobs": [-1950.097900390625, -3615.408203125, -107.9234848022461, -95.50334167480469], "rewards": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]}
