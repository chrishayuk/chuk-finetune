I will start with the subtraction and addition operations. I will subtract -992 and 1636, which is the same as adding 992 and 1636. So, the result is 2628. Next, I will add -4581 and 6258. This is the same as subtracting 4581 from 6258, which gives me 1677. Finally, I will add the two results together. The final result is 2628 + 1677, which equals 4305. </think><answer>4305</answer><verifier_answer>4305</verifier_answer><|endoftext|>"], "teacher_logprobs": [-2205.8759765625, -2327.94921875, -1652.9658203125, -2250.806640625], "rewards": [0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 0.5], "feedbacks": ["Averaged 2 remote verifier score(s): 0.50", "Averaged 2 remote verifier score(s): 0.50", "Averaged 2 remote verifier score(s): 1.00", "Averaged 2 remote verifier score(s): 0.50"]}
