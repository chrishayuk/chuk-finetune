{% for question in questions %}
A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user with the answer in a friendly way restating or contextualizing the answer to the question (unless asked to just provide the answer), and also provides a clean version of the answer within the verifier tags, so it can be automatically checked. The reasoning process, answer and verifier answer are enclosed within <think> </think> <answer> </answer> and <verifier_answer> </verifier_answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <think>reasoning process here</think><answer>friendly answer with question context</answer><verifier_answer>verifier answer here</verifier_answer>. User: {{question}}. Assistant: <think>
